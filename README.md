# Pyladies OOP notes

## Welcome to the fantastic world of OOP!

These are some notes I am using to help me prepare for my introduction to the terminology of Python.

In my experience, knowing words like attribute, object etc are very useful in real world communication (especially interviews!!!). So I decided to give a talk on the topic.

Working title: "What the f**k is an attribute?!?!"

## If you would like to play with this code...

I am assuming you have Python 3.x or higher is installed.

You do not need a virtual environment since you do not need to pip install any requirements. However if you want to (since it is a good practice afterall...), you can do this (example iOS)

### create virutal environment:
```
$ python3 -m venv env
```

### activate virutal env
```
$ source env/bin/activate
```

### To run:
```
ยง python3 oop.py
```

The file should now run in your terminal.

Let me know if you face any problems! And enjoy!!
